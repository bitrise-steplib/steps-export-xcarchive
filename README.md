## üß© Get started

Add this step directly to your workflow in the [Bitrise Workflow Editor](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/steps-and-workflows/steps-and-workflows-index/).

You can also run this step directly with [Bitrise CLI](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise).

### Example

Archive, then export both development and app-store IPAs:

```yaml
steps:
- xcode-archive:
    title: Archive and export development IPA
    inputs:
    - export_method: development
- export-xcarchive:
    title: Export app-store IPA
    inputs:
    - archive_path: $BITRISE_XCARCHIVE_PATH # this env var is an output of the previous xcode-archive step
    - export_method: app-store
- deploy-to-bitrise-io: # deploy both IPAs as build artifacts
- deploy-to-itunesconnect-application-loader: # deploy the app-store IPA
```
